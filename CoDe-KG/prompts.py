COREf_FICL_SYSTEM = r"""You are a coreference resolution agent. Below is a text passage (any domain) presented as tokenized text with indices. Your task is to identify and annotate coreference expressions within the text. For each co-referent expression:

- Record the surface form under "Expression".
- Use the provided token indices as "StartToken" and "EndToken" (they are the same for single-token expressions).
- Map each expression to its antecedent using "RefersTo" --- either a noun phrase or named entity from the text.
- Only include pronouns or repeated noun phrases referring back to a prior concept or entity.

Use this format:
{
"Expression": "string",
"StartToken": int,
"EndToken": int,
"RefersTo": "string"
}

S1 -> ...
S2 -> ...

one per line, and nothing else.

Example 1:
Input:
“A prospective cohort study was conducted in Leeds, UK, based on routinely collected data from a service that allowed patients with symptoms of lung cancer to request CXR.”
Output:
S1 -> A prospective cohort study was conducted in Leeds, UK.
S2 -> The study was based on routinely collected data from a service.
S3 -> The service allowed patients with symptoms of lung cancer to request CXR.

Example 2:
Input:
“After the cells were treated with the drug, which had been synthesized in our lab, we measured the change in fluorescence using a spectrophotometer.”
Output:
S1 -> We measured the change in fluorescence using a spectrophotometer.
S2 -> The cells were treated with the drug.
S3 -> The drug had been synthesized in our lab.

Now apply the same process to this new sentence.

Example 1:
Input:
“Lung cancer stands prominently among the foremost contributors to human mortality, distinguished by its elevated fatality rate and the second-highest incidence rate among malignancies, and the metastatic dissemination of lung cancer stands as a primary determinant of its elevated mortality and recurrence rates.”
Output:
S1 -> Lung cancer stands prominently among the foremost contributors to human mortality.
S2 -> It is distinguished by its elevated fatality rate and the second-highest incidence rate among malignancies.
S3 -> The metastatic dissemination of lung cancer stands as a primary determinant of its elevated mortality and recurrence rates.

Example 2:
Input:
“Climate change accelerates the melting of polar ice, and rising sea levels threaten coastal communities around the world.”
Output:
S1 -> Climate change accelerates the melting of polar ice.
S2 -> Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities around the world.

Output:
S1 -> Lung cancer is the leading cause of US cancer-related deaths.
S2 -> Lung cancer screening with a low-dose chest computed tomography scan is now standard of care for a high-risk eligible population.
S3 -> Lung cancer screening is recommended for a high-risk, eligible population.

REL_EXTRACT_SYSTEM = r"""You are a knowledge graph relationship extraction agent for text in any domain (science, geography, history, medicine, business, etc.). Your task is to extract structured relationships from simple sentences to create knowledge graph triples. Each triple should contain two entities and the relationship between them.

- Analyze the sentence structure and identify key components.
- Extract all meaningful entities (nouns, noun phrases, proper nouns, concepts, events, places).
- Identify relationships between entities based on verbs, prepositions, and semantic meaning.
- Form triples (Entity 1 -> Relationship -> Entity 2) as structured relationships.
- Validate that each triple captures meaningful semantic information.

Examples:

Input:
"Regulating miR-497-5p provides a potential targeted therapy for lung cancer treatment."
Output:
[{
"Entity 1": "regulating miR-497-5p",
"Entity 2": "lung cancer targeted treatment",

Input:
"The activation of caspase signal pathway was the reason for stronger apoptosis."
